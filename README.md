## Installation And Usage
1. Installation
   - Download/clone this repository and create a proper project folder where you will extract this repo's contents. Then open terminal (make sure you are in the project's directory).
   - Create a virtual environment using the command ````py -m venv yourVenvName```` and activate it using ````yourVenvName\Scripts\activate.bat````.
   - Then run the following command ````pip install -r requirements.txt````. With this, all the dependencies will be installed in your virtual environment. 
> **Note:** *If any dependency is missing or an error shows up, install it using ````pip install moduleName````*.

2. Usage
   - Open your project folder and go to the terminal and activate your virtual environment. Then type ````streamlit run src\main.py```` and the app will open in your web 
   browser. Now you can interact with it or play with the code and add your own features and if you wish - you can deploy your own version of any deep learning model.
