Deep Detect My Handwriting is an app that uses various deep learning models to predict the digits
and the alphabets that you draw on the canvas. 

- For detecting the digits, it uses two models - ANN (acc=98.42%) and CNN (acc=99.08%). 
- For detecting the alphabets, it uses only one model - CNN (acc=99.30%).


***Instructions:***
- Choose a navigation mode from the sidebar.
- For drawing and predictions, follow these instructions:
    1. Check on **Drawing Mode** to enter the mode.
    2. Draw any digit from 0-9 (if in *Detect My Digit* mode) or capital letters A-Z (if in *Detect My Alphabet* mode). 
    3. Press 'Show Results' button and the predictions will appear on the screen.
    4. To redraw, uncheck on **Drawing Mode** to exit. Then double click on the drawn object to 
        remove it. Finally, check the drawing mode again.

>*Note:* Draw mulitple times and try differently to make the most of the app 👍. 

ENJOY THE APP! 💖
